The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Far too much waffling!,3.0,"It really doesn‚Äôt give me any pleasure to write this mainly negative review. I mention that because I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series, in fact I gave it a glowing 5 star Amazon review when I read it last year. However, I‚Äôm afraid this second outing just didn‚Äôt cut the mustard as far as I‚Äôm concerned.As with Mr Osman‚Äôs debut novel, I sat down with this one eagerly anticipating the cozy mystery which would no doubt await me. So, I eased into my comfy armchair, a pot of freshly brewed tea sitting on the side table, and began turning those pages (on my Kindle). And you know what, I was soon whisked back to the lovely Coopers Chase retirement village, and it was so nice to get reacquainted with Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron, and Ibrahim, those elderly, self-appointed sleuths - aka The Thursday Murder Club. For a couple of hours I was really enjoying myself, and I soon got caught up in the lives of these likeable characters. In this outing, Elizabeth receives an unexpected letter, delivered under her door, and originating from someone from her younger days. This ‚Äòblast from the past‚Äô character is central to a plot that eventually develops into a case for the four amateur detectives to solve. So, at this stage in the story I was hopeful that this second novel was going to be at least as good, if not better, than the first one. However, after another few chapters my heart began to sink, and I found myself struggling to keep interested in a story that slowly but surely meandered all over the place, and got sillier by the minute.The writing here is undemanding, with short, bite-size chapters, so regardless of my misgivings, I was still able to soldier on in order to (a) find out what happens in the end, and (b) enjoy the occasional funny quip or observation. However, hand on heart, the escapades of the main and supporting characters in this somewhat crazy plot really did get farcical, and my patience was tested many times. There were all sorts of silly shenanigans going on involving a local drug dealer, ¬£20 million in stolen diamonds, the head of an American/Mexican cartel, and several cold-blooded murderers etc. Interspersed with the action was the romantic exploits of DCI Chris Hudson, who decides to have a fling with his assistant‚Äôs mother - those interactions were often cringeworthy to say the least. In fact many of the sections relating to Chris Hudson had me rolling my eyes. One paragraph (I kid you not) is devoted to Chris‚Äôs views on peppers. Here‚Äôs a one sentence quote from that same paragraph: ‚ÄòChris had always fantasised about being the sort of man who might buy the red, yellow and green peppers.‚Äô ü§î Makes me wonder how he ever made it to a DCI! Another irritation were the chapters headed: Joyce, which is where the reader gets to see what Joyce writes in her daily diary, this is ‚Äòwittering on‚Äô taken to a new, extreme level - you have been warned!The bottom line is that I came away from this novel sadly disappointed. One thing is for sure, this was ¬£9.99 NOT WELL SPENT! Despite my many quibbles though, I‚Äôve given this book three generous Amazon stars because of the entertainment value at the beginning, and the odd moments of humour peppered throughout this nonsense. Many thanks for checking out my review, I hope you found my comments and observation throughout useful.

The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),It is literally painful to read this book.,1.0,"This was not what I expected. I had steeled myself for a cozy-crime story which would, no doubt, be awful but at least be a harmless way of passing some time. However, it‚Äôs got ‚Äúserious‚Äù bits in it; but this book is more Val Doonican than Val McDermid. There are moments, basically unskilled shifts in tone, which are probably meant to be shocking but are telegraphed pages in advance, and make the attempt at a serious crime novel look leaden and clumsy.This book is awful. I punished myself reading it. Every sentence is overwritten to breaking point. It is very hard to care about any of the characters because they are all so badly written. There is one called Elizabeth who is nearly seventy but talks like she‚Äôs twenty; one of the many signs of poor characterisation in this book. I suspect she is meant to be the ‚Äústrong female character‚Äù in the story, which is par for the course these days for any book, but this one lacks strong characters of any gender. The villain is bereft of any dimension, let alone the requisite three. This book has three parts and 84 chapters for some reason. 84. This is not the hallmark of competence, and neither is writing a story in the present tense just to be ‚Äúedgy‚Äù.A plot that does nothing, characters that irritate and attempts at humour that do nothing but irritate, this is the last-minute homework of a talentless amateur desperately trying to avoid failing a creative writing course. No book can literally be painful to read; words on a page cannot actually cause you physical discomfort. But you know what? ‚ÄúThe Man Who Died Twice‚Äù very nearly makes such a book an excruciating reality. If this is 21st century literature then you have to fear for the future of the written word."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Enjoy it for the daft bit of fun that it is,5.0,"I have read a few negative reviews of this book on here, and in my opinion they all have one thing in common. Namely that they are taking it far too seriously, much more seriously than it is intended to be taken. If this book were a bottle of wine it would be of the popular 'quaffable' variety that wine snobs look down their noses at. In other words, this book, metaphorically speaking, is not intended to be rolled around the inside of a carefully chosen glass, sniffed, gurgled, analysed and picked apart for the benefit of other snobs. It is simply intended to be enjoyed and to make you feel good. On that front it cannot be faulted. I loved it for its daftness and improbability and I read it from start to finish in one sitting. However, if you are hoping for a serious and plausible whodunnit with believable, realistic characters then you are going to be disappointed."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Back with the fabulous four for more first class entertainment. Fun from start to finish,5.0,"Are you ready for round two of the comic crime capers that come courtesy of Coopers Chase retirement village‚Äôs most celebrated residents? Well I certainly was when I picked up the sequel to Richard Osman‚Äôs bestselling debut The Thursday Murder Club, having declared it one of my favourite reads of 2020. Exploding onto the amateur detective scene with as much vitality and enthusiasm as four old age pensioners can muster (and it‚Äôs a lot!) they won the hearts of readers up and down the country so the chance to catch up with the likes of Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron and Ibrahim as they wheedle, manipulate, confuse, connive and charm their way through another investigation is an opportunity too good to miss. I‚Äôm happy to report that this crime busting quartet led by ex spook Elizabeth are back with a vengeance, hogging the limelight as they engage in some lateral thinking and uproarious antics in order to outsmart the latest round of villains who threaten to darken their doorstep. Even though they are busy with their far from successful surveillance of local drug dealer Connie Johnson,  Fairhaven‚Äôs finest cops DCI Chris Hudson and his partner PC Donna De Freitas are again on hand to assist our favourite senior citizens especially when Ibrahim becomes the victim of a vicious mugging. Polish builder Bogdan completes the eclectic band of justice seekers determined to solve the mystery behind a letter addressed to Elizabeth that appears to be written from the deceased Marcus Carmichael. A ghost from the past is all it takes to alert our fantastic four to skulduggery within the criminal fraternity in which the recovery of twenty million pounds worth of diamonds is of paramount importance. Move over the A team the OAP team are here to save the day!!First off I have to comment on how wonderful it is to be reunited with all these familiar characters. I‚Äôve missed their camaraderie, their hilarious conversations, their individual foibles and their ability to behave badly without arousing suspicion. It‚Äôs all this plus the  friendships, the loyalty and support that exist between the gang of four and their growing band of associates that makes this such a delight to read. The dialogue is off the scale humorous so that from the opening discussion in which Joyce is deliberating with her fellow murder club members whether to join Instagram or get a dog for company you know there are going to be laughs aplenty. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve read a crime novel where I‚Äôve laughed so much. Thanks to these intrepid, smart, inventive, resourceful and energetic lot who prove age is no barrier when it comes to enjoying life to the max I had a permanent grin on my face as I followed their escapades. I could only marvel at the ingenious ways in which they disentangle themselves from sticky situations, somehow never the worse for wear!There‚Äôs been a few developments in the lives of these characters since we were last in their company but they are all still game for a laugh and ready to rise to this latest crime solving challenge. Formerly unlucky in love DCI Chris is now on a strict diet thanks to his blossoming relationship with Patrice, who just happens to be Donna‚Äôs mum; Joyce appears to have swapped baking cakes for making sequin embellished friendship bracelets; Bogdan is happily keeping Stephen company challenging him to countless chess games whilst Elizabeth is outmanoeuvring criminal masterminds and Donna still hasn‚Äôt found a suitable boyfriend. It‚Äôs fair to say I don‚Äôt think I could ever tire of these characters who for all their lighthearted silly banter are superb friends to one another. Ron‚Äôs friendship with Ibrahim, becoming his constant companion whilst this quiet,careful and unadventurous man slowly heals is so heartwarming. So too is the new found friendship between Ron‚Äôs grandson Kendrick and the ex psychiatrist who needless to say both prove invaluable in the race to discover the missing diamonds.Combining Elizabeth‚Äôs sharp mind,Joyce‚Äôs flirting, Ibrahim‚Äôs impressive observational skills and Ron‚Äôs use of disguise and underhand tactics you can be sure that retrieving the stolen diamonds is on the cards. However Elizabeth and her acolytes have a few obstacles to overcome on the way to success. Expect danger, devious tactics, double crossings and a few dead bodies! Richard Osman skilfully weaves each strand of the plot together, drawing every single character into the main arena so you‚Äôre never quite sure what to expect next. Literally anything can and does happen! All in all it‚Äôs riotous, rollicking great fun!As for characters it‚Äôs pointless trying to pick a favourite when the author spoils you for choice but I‚Äôm going to anyway!  Elizabeth as the brains behind the operation obviously stands out but once again it‚Äôs ex nurse Joyce who through her diary entries had me in stitches. I just love her voice with it‚Äôs mixture of naivety, flirtatiousness, kindness and eccentricity. Her heart is pure gold but she isn‚Äôt above a bit of gentle persuasion and coercion as Ibrahim knows only too well! The other three members of the murder club couldn‚Äôt wish for a better friend. If I‚Äôm honest I love them all! I like how underneath all the comic capering Richard Osman isn‚Äôt afraid to touch on the type of problems associated with old age such as dementia (Stephen) and how easy it can be to lose one‚Äôs confidence following an unexpected turn of events (Ibrahim). Without being in the least bit patronising and keeping the tone lighthearted he manages to address these issues with both wit, compassion and respect so despite the obstacles they face their value as characters is not diminished and they are not overlooked.If you loved The Thursday Murder Club then I think you‚Äôll love the sequel even more. Richard Osman has triumphed once again with a novel that provides fantastic all round entertainment. Quintessentially English, the plot is pacy, the characters are divine and the humour contagious so it‚Äôs hardly surprising The Man Who Died Twice has shot to the top (again!) of my list of favourite 2021 reads.Super easy to devour in one sitting this is one of those highly anticipated novels you can‚Äôt wait to start yet you don‚Äôt want to finish simply because you‚Äôre in such splendid company. This is a book that keeps on giving right up until the very last word. Fingers crossed this isn‚Äôt the last we‚Äôll hear of the fabulous four. First class and without hesitation a 5 ‚≠êÔ∏èread."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Better than the first book in the series.,4.0,"Rating:  4.0/5After the phenomenal success of ""The Thursday Murder Club"" there was never really any doubt that there would be a sequel.  Although I thought ""The Thursday Murder Club"" was good, I didn't think it was great.  In this follow-up, Richard Osman has built on the positive elements of the series opener and delivered a very enjoyable read that is more polished and accomplished than its forerunner.The septuagenarian residents of Coopers Chase, who make up the eponymous ""Thursday Murder Club"", are back again, but with a new mystery to get their dentures into.  Although the plot is not directly related to book one, there are occasional references to events that took place in that earlier story.  It would certainly be of benefit to any potential readers if they were already familiar with the main cast of characters.  Therefore, I would suggest that this would not work particularly well as a standalone read.Richard Osman's style won't appeal to everyone, but it does to me.  It is apparent that he is learning from experience and developing as a writer.  His style in ""The Man Who Died Twice"" is noticeably more relaxed and fluent than it was in book one.  Whereas I felt that the murder mystery in the first book was essentially just a superficial vehicle to allow Richard Osman to explore the world of these pensioners, the plot this time around is a little more robust and has a perfectly solid mystery adventure at its heart.  As you would expect, there is still the clever observational humour along the way and there are even moments that are, by turn, heart-warming or poignant.Not everybody enjoyed Richard Osman's debut novel - in fact, there were reviewers who loathed it.  Nonetheless, on the back of the author's popular appeal, it sold in mind-blowingly massive quantities.  So many people who rarely (if ever) read novels, went out and bought ""The Thursday Murder Club"", or loaned it from their local library.  Even if you detested it, Richard Osman deserves significant credit for inspiring huge numbers of non-regular readers to put their nose into a book again.  Although I believe ""The Man Who Died Twice"" is a better novel than its predecessor, there will still be those who will hate it with a vengeance - but the many readers that lapped up the first book will, almost certainly, love this one too."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Another wonderful book from Richard!,5.0,"As enjoyable as the first book was,  this second one is even better! The plotline draws you in further and further until it is racing  along pulling the reader breathlessly after it. The Thursday Club members and their friends and families are beautifully crafted and you just can't help liking them as if they were real people you could meet on the bus or in the street. The baddies are clearly bad people  who deserve everything Elizabeth decides they should get.The actual plot is suitably complicated without being pretentious or too over the top and has some excellent twists and turns. And the lovely threads of humour throughout the book just add that final magical ingredient that turn this book into a complete joy to read! (See Richard?  Some of us actually do read all the way through the acknowledgements!)Fully deserved five stars and well worth reading, I will be recommending it to all my friends. Well done Richard. Already looking forward to more adventures of the lovely members of the Thursday Murder Club."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Not a great sequel.,3.0,"Richard is a very clever and successful man but, sorry, he is not a great author. I enjoyed The Thursday Murder Club as it was different and the plot around the 4 main characters in the retirement home was a plausible, if eccentric one, although you could find a number of holes in the story. What is this second book, crime, comedy or farce, a bit of all three and that is part of the problem. We lose the cosy relationship between the four club members as we encompass drug dealing, international crime, mafia, MI5, you name it they are involved! The book is 420 pages and there are a lot of side stories that add little or nothing to the main story. Agatha Christie with both Miss Marple and Poirot showed the police to be inadequate to her characters but in a believable way. The depiction of Chris and Donna the local CID is ridiculous. The way that they get involved with the club members including supplying confidential information would result in their removal from office many times over. I know this is meant to be a light hearted comedy but you need to write that around a storyline that has some plausibility.NOW FOR SOME SPOILERS SO DO NOT READ ON IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SOME DETAIL.Elizabeth gives Bogdan ¬£10K in cash to buy drugs in the sting on Ryan, where does she get the cash?In one chapter police from London are brought in to help with the Connie, Ryan drug story. But then no mention and the local police continue with the case.Ron acts as a plumberto plant drugs in Ryan's cistern as a sting. The police are told where to find them and he is charged. A defence lawyer would be all over that.The Mafia guy flies in to a private airport and there are Elizabeth and Joyce with taxi they persuade him to travel in. I think a Mafia boss would have been picked up by a trusted accomplice.Near the end Bogdan shoots Sue, the MI5 agent, in the shoulder. This was all with goid intentions but no mention that he might be charged with an offence?I could go on with many other examples. Maybe I am over thinking this?Finally we have the ending which I will not spoil. Suffice to say I got to the final chapter to find a  new character and was completely confused until the end. Apparently this type of ending was one Richard had read in a book 30 years ago and wanted to repeat.Well I will leave it here. Finally if you want to read a good series of crime novels I suggest Anna Legat. She probable sells a fraction of Richard's but I think you would enjoy her modern twist of a combination of Miss Marple and Midsomer Murders. I have nothing to do with Anna but found her books recently through an ex colleague of mine."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Love is all you need‚Ä¶,5.0,"This is the second novel in The Thursday Murder Club collection. I finished the first one year ago to the day and I loved it!It is set in a retirement village in southern England, where, every Thursday afternoon, some of the residents meet to try and solve ‚Äòcold case‚Äô murders. I did wonder whether the second book would live up to the first. But, I needn‚Äôt have.This story revolves around a robbery of twenty million pounds worth of diamonds. In trying to track them down, several murders are committed  and our old friends have to pool their resources and skills to solve the mystery of who killed the victims. As the story develops, we get to learn much more about each of the characters who survived from book one, which is very much appreciated.So, The Man Who Died Twice is exactly what I expected - it is a quintessential British Murder mystery that is well written and observed. The characters are beautifully revealed as the story progresses and the dialogue between them is realistic.The story has some interesting plot lines and ‚Äòtwists‚Äô - very few of which I was able to predict along the way. The ‚Äòbig reveal‚Äô however did keep me guessing and the ending was very satisfying.All in all, The Man Who Died Twice is an enjoyable read that held my interest throughout and kept me turning the pages.  I‚Äôm still hoping that I end up in a place like Coopers Chase in my ‚Äútwilight days‚Äô and that Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron and Ibrahim are all still there to welcome me. I‚Äôm putting my name down now and blocking out every Thursday afternoon in my schedule!"
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Thank you Richard,5.0,You have taken me by the hand and safely delivered me after a thrilling ride. Your warmth and sincerity has heartened and gladdened my soul.  Look forward to meeting again next year
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Brilliant follow up to the Thursday Murder Club,4.0,"I'll start by saying that I very much enjoyed this. The plot was great, we learnt more about Elizabeth and the feel of the novel is almost self-deprecating. It's gentle and quietly sarcastic. However there were some bittersweet and also very touching moments especially surrounding Ibrahim.Ibrahim is enjoying his life until he is mugged and loses all his confidence. He struggles to feel optimistic, becomes reclusive and refuses to leave his flat. It is heart-breaking to watch this sweet man become a shadow of his former self. But this is tempered by the support from the Thursday Murder Club members. Ron stays by Ibrahim's side, refusing to let him be alone at the hospital. Joyce gently persuades him out and Elizabeth ensures that his attacker receives retribution. It is still heartbreaking though. Richard, what are you doing to us?I love the interplay between Elizabeth and Joyce. Elizabeth remains brilliant yet scary. as Joyce says I would not want to be her enemy. She is resourceful with a very dubious past. But in this novel she doesn't entirely get her own way all of the time. When she is being especially intimidating, Joyce is the cosy character by her side.Joyce definitely feels more well-rounded in this novel. She is still slightly man-mad and is usually oblivious to the solutions that Elizabeth has worked out. But she is warm and motherly even to those on the wrong side of Elizabeth.Bogdan's character is also fleshed out. He seems to have become a literary pin-up, just as capable as Elizabeth (who he adores) and appears to have been inducted into the Thursday Murder Club. He is happy to do Elizabeth's bidding.Amazingly I did manage to work out the murderer, but i enjoyed the journey and loved learning all abut the inner workings of MI5.The book is a worthy successor to the Thursday Murder Club and I am already looking forward to the next in the series about these wonderful characters."

Quintessentially English, the plot is pacy, the characters are divine and the humour contagious so it‚Äôs hardly surprising The Man Who Died Twice has shot to the top (again!) of my list of favourite 2021 reads.Super easy to devour in one sitting this is one of those highly anticipated novels you can‚Äôt wait to start yet you don‚Äôt want to finish simply because you‚Äôre in such splendid company. This is a book that keeps on giving right up until the very last word. Fingers crossed this isn‚Äôt the last we‚Äôll hear of the fabulous four. First class and without hesitation a 5 ‚≠êÔ∏èread."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Better than the first book in the series.,4.0,"Rating:  4.0/5After the phenomenal success of ""The Thursday Murder Club"" there was never really any doubt that there would be a sequel.  Although I thought ""The Thursday Murder Club"" was good, I didn't think it was great.  In this follow-up, Richard Osman has built on the positive elements of the series opener and delivered a very enjoyable read that is more polished and accomplished than its forerunner.The septuagenarian residents of Coopers Chase, who make up the eponymous ""Thursday Murder Club"", are back again, but with a new mystery to get their dentures into.  Although the plot is not directly related to book one, there are occasional references to events that took place in that earlier story.  It would certainly be of benefit to any potential readers if they were already familiar with the main cast of characters.  Therefore, I would suggest that this would not work particularly well as a standalone read.Richard Osman's style won't appeal to everyone, but it does to me.  It is apparent that he is learning from experience and developing as a writer.  His style in ""The Man Who Died Twice"" is noticeably more relaxed and fluent than it was in book one.  Whereas I felt that the murder mystery in the first book was essentially just a superficial vehicle to allow Richard Osman to explore the world of these pensioners, the plot this time around is a little more robust and has a perfectly solid mystery adventure at its heart.  As you would expect, there is still the clever observational humour along the way and there are even moments that are, by turn, heart-warming or poignant.Not everybody enjoyed Richard Osman's debut novel - in fact, there were reviewers who loathed it.  Nonetheless, on the back of the author's popular appeal, it sold in mind-blowingly massive quantities.  So many people who rarely (if ever) read novels, went out and bought ""The Thursday Murder Club"", or loaned it from their local library.  Even if you detested it, Richard Osman deserves significant credit for inspiring huge numbers of non-regular readers to put their nose into a book again.  Although I believe ""The Man Who Died Twice"" is a better novel than its predecessor, there will still be those who will hate it with a vengeance - but the many readers that lapped up the first book will, almost certainly, love this one too."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Another wonderful book from Richard!,5.0,"As enjoyable as the first book was,  this second one is even better! The plotline draws you in further and further until it is racing  along pulling the reader breathlessly after it. The Thursday Club members and their friends and families are beautifully crafted and you just can't help liking them as if they were real people you could meet on the bus or in the street. The baddies are clearly bad people  who deserve everything Elizabeth decides they should get.The actual plot is suitably complicated without being pretentious or too over the top and has some excellent twists and turns. And the lovely threads of humour throughout the book just add that final magical ingredient that turn this book into a complete joy to read! (See Richard?  Some of us actually do read all the way through the acknowledgements!)Fully deserved five stars and well worth reading, I will be recommending it to all my friends. Well done Richard. Already looking forward to more adventures of the lovely members of the Thursday Murder Club."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Not a great sequel.,3.0,"Richard is a very clever and successful man but, sorry, he is not a great author. I enjoyed The Thursday Murder Club as it was different and the plot around the 4 main characters in the retirement home was a plausible, if eccentric one, although you could find a number of holes in the story. What is this second book, crime, comedy or farce, a bit of all three and that is part of the problem. We lose the cosy relationship between the four club members as we encompass drug dealing, international crime, mafia, MI5, you name it they are involved! The book is 420 pages and there are a lot of side stories that add little or nothing to the main story. Agatha Christie with both Miss Marple and Poirot showed the police to be inadequate to her characters but in a believable way. The depiction of Chris and Donna the local CID is ridiculous. The way that they get involved with the club members including supplying confidential information would result in their removal from office many times over. I know this is meant to be a light hearted comedy but you need to write that around a storyline that has some plausibility.NOW FOR SOME SPOILERS SO DO NOT READ ON IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SOME DETAIL.Elizabeth gives Bogdan ¬£10K in cash to buy drugs in the sting on Ryan, where does she get the cash?In one chapter police from London are brought in to help with the Connie, Ryan drug story. But then no mention and the local police continue with the case.Ron acts as a plumberto plant drugs in Ryan's cistern as a sting. The police are told where to find them and he is charged. A defence lawyer would be all over that.The Mafia guy flies in to a private airport and there are Elizabeth and Joyce with taxi they persuade him to travel in. I think a Mafia boss would have been picked up by a trusted accomplice.Near the end Bogdan shoots Sue, the MI5 agent, in the shoulder. This was all with goid intentions but no mention that he might be charged with an offence?I could go on with many other examples. Maybe I am over thinking this?Finally we have the ending which I will not spoil. Suffice to say I got to the final chapter to find a  new character and was completely confused until the end. Apparently this type of ending was one Richard had read in a book 30 years ago and wanted to repeat.Well I will leave it here. Finally if you want to read a good series of crime novels I suggest Anna Legat. She probable sells a fraction of Richard's but I think you would enjoy her modern twist of a combination of Miss Marple and Midsomer Murders. I have nothing to do with Anna but found her books recently through an ex colleague of mine."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Love is all you need‚Ä¶,5.0,"This is the second novel in The Thursday Murder Club collection. I finished the first one year ago to the day and I loved it!It is set in a retirement village in southern England, where, every Thursday afternoon, some of the residents meet to try and solve ‚Äòcold case‚Äô murders. I did wonder whether the second book would live up to the first. But, I needn‚Äôt have.This story revolves around a robbery of twenty million pounds worth of diamonds. In trying to track them down, several murders are committed  and our old friends have to pool their resources and skills to solve the mystery of who killed the victims. As the story develops, we get to learn much more about each of the characters who survived from book one, which is very much appreciated.So, The Man Who Died Twice is exactly what I expected - it is a quintessential British Murder mystery that is well written and observed. The characters are beautifully revealed as the story progresses and the dialogue between them is realistic.The story has some interesting plot lines and ‚Äòtwists‚Äô - very few of which I was able to predict along the way. The ‚Äòbig reveal‚Äô however did keep me guessing and the ending was very satisfying.All in all, The Man Who Died Twice is an enjoyable read that held my interest throughout and kept me turning the pages.  I‚Äôm still hoping that I end up in a place like Coopers Chase in my ‚Äútwilight days‚Äô and that Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron and Ibrahim are all still there to welcome me. I‚Äôm putting my name down now and blocking out every Thursday afternoon in my schedule!"
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Thank you Richard,5.0,You have taken me by the hand and safely delivered me after a thrilling ride. Your warmth and sincerity has heartened and gladdened my soul.  Look forward to meeting again next year
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Brilliant follow up to the Thursday Murder Club,4.0,"I'll start by saying that I very much enjoyed this. The plot was great, we learnt more about Elizabeth and the feel of the novel is almost self-deprecating. It's gentle and quietly sarcastic. However there were some bittersweet and also very touching moments especially surrounding Ibrahim.Ibrahim is enjoying his life until he is mugged and loses all his confidence. He struggles to feel optimistic, becomes reclusive and refuses to leave his flat. It is heart-breaking to watch this sweet man become a shadow of his former self. But this is tempered by the support from the Thursday Murder Club members. Ron stays by Ibrahim's side, refusing to let him be alone at the hospital. Joyce gently persuades him out and Elizabeth ensures that his attacker receives retribution. It is still heartbreaking though. Richard, what are you doing to us?I love the interplay between Elizabeth and Joyce. Elizabeth remains brilliant yet scary. as Joyce says I would not want to be her enemy. She is resourceful with a very dubious past. But in this novel she doesn't entirely get her own way all of the time. When she is being especially intimidating, Joyce is the cosy character by her side.Joyce definitely feels more well-rounded in this novel. She is still slightly man-mad and is usually oblivious to the solutions that Elizabeth has worked out. But she is warm and motherly even to those on the wrong side of Elizabeth.Bogdan's character is also fleshed out. He seems to have become a literary pin-up, just as capable as Elizabeth (who he adores) and appears to have been inducted into the Thursday Murder Club. He is happy to do Elizabeth's bidding.Amazingly I did manage to work out the murderer, but i enjoyed the journey and loved learning all abut the inner workings of MI5.The book is a worthy successor to the Thursday Murder Club and I am already looking forward to the next in the series about these wonderful characters."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Far too much waffling!,3.0,"It really doesn‚Äôt give me any pleasure to write this mainly negative review. I mention that because I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series, in fact I gave it a glowing 5 star Amazon review when I read it last year. However, I‚Äôm afraid this second outing just didn‚Äôt cut the mustard as far as I‚Äôm concerned.As with Mr Osman‚Äôs debut novel, I sat down with this one eagerly anticipating the cozy mystery which would no doubt await me. So, I eased into my comfy armchair, a pot of freshly brewed tea sitting on the side table, and began turning those pages (on my Kindle). And you know what, I was soon whisked back to the lovely Coopers Chase retirement village, and it was so nice to get reacquainted with Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron, and Ibrahim, those elderly, self-appointed sleuths - aka The Thursday Murder Club. For a couple of hours I was really enjoying myself, and I soon got caught up in the lives of these likeable characters. In this outing, Elizabeth receives an unexpected letter, delivered under her door, and originating from someone from her younger days. This ‚Äòblast from the past‚Äô character is central to a plot that eventually develops into a case for the four amateur detectives to solve. So, at this stage in the story I was hopeful that this second novel was going to be at least as good, if not better, than the first one. However, after another few chapters my heart began to sink, and I found myself struggling to keep interested in a story that slowly but surely meandered all over the place, and got sillier by the minute.The writing here is undemanding, with short, bite-size chapters, so regardless of my misgivings, I was still able to soldier on in order to (a) find out what happens in the end, and (b) enjoy the occasional funny quip or observation. However, hand on heart, the escapades of the main and supporting characters in this somewhat crazy plot really did get farcical, and my patience was tested many times. There were all sorts of silly shenanigans going on involving a local drug dealer, ¬£20 million in stolen diamonds, the head of an American/Mexican cartel, and several cold-blooded murderers etc. Interspersed with the action was the romantic exploits of DCI Chris Hudson, who decides to have a fling with his assistant‚Äôs mother - those interactions were often cringeworthy to say the least. In fact many of the sections relating to Chris Hudson had me rolling my eyes. One paragraph (I kid you not) is devoted to Chris‚Äôs views on peppers. Here‚Äôs a one sentence quote from that same paragraph: ‚ÄòChris had always fantasised about being the sort of man who might buy the red, yellow and green peppers.‚Äô ü§î Makes me wonder how he ever made it to a DCI! Another irritation were the chapters headed: Joyce, which is where the reader gets to see what Joyce writes in her daily diary, this is ‚Äòwittering on‚Äô taken to a new, extreme level - you have been warned!The bottom line is that I came away from this novel sadly disappointed. One thing is for sure, this was ¬£9.99 NOT WELL SPENT! Despite my many quibbles though, I‚Äôve given this book three generous Amazon stars because of the entertainment value at the beginning, and the odd moments of humour peppered throughout this nonsense. Many thanks for checking out my review, I hope you found my comments and observation throughout useful. Oh, and I‚Äôd like to leave you with a quote I rather like: A room without books is like a body without a soul‚Ä¶.üìñ + üìö = üòä"
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),It is literally painful to read this book.,1.0,"This was not what I expected. I had steeled myself for a cozy-crime story which would, no doubt, be awful but at least be a harmless way of passing some time. However, it‚Äôs got ‚Äúserious‚Äù bits in it; but this book is more Val Doonican than Val McDermid. There are moments, basically unskilled shifts in tone, which are probably meant to be shocking but are telegraphed pages in advance, and make the attempt at a serious crime novel look leaden and clumsy.This book is awful. I punished myself reading it. Every sentence is overwritten to breaking point. It is very hard to care about any of the characters because they are all so badly written. There is one called Elizabeth who is nearly seventy but talks like she‚Äôs twenty; one of the many signs of poor characterisation in this book. I suspect she is meant to be the ‚Äústrong female character‚Äù in the story, which is par for the course these days for any book, but this one lacks strong characters of any gender. The villain is bereft of any dimension, let alone the requisite three. This book has three parts and 84 chapters for some reason. 84. This is not the hallmark of competence, and neither is writing a story in the present tense just to be ‚Äúedgy‚Äù.A plot that does nothing, characters that irritate and attempts at humour that do nothing but irritate, this is the last-minute homework of a talentless amateur desperately trying to avoid failing a creative writing course. No book can literally be painful to read; words on a page cannot actually cause you physical discomfort. But you know what? ‚ÄúThe Man Who Died Twice‚Äù very nearly makes such a book an excruciating reality. If this is 21st century literature then you have to fear for the future of the written word."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Enjoy it for the daft bit of fun that it is,5.0,"I have read a few negative reviews of this book on here, and in my opinion they all have one thing in common. Namely that they are taking it far too seriously, much more seriously than it is intended to be taken. If this book were a bottle of wine it would be of the popular 'quaffable' variety that wine snobs look down their noses at. In other words, this book, metaphorically speaking, is not intended to be rolled around the inside of a carefully chosen glass, sniffed, gurgled, analysed and picked apart for the benefit of other snobs. It is simply intended to be enjoyed and to make you feel good. On that front it cannot be faulted. I loved it for its daftness and improbability and I read it from start to finish in one sitting. However, if you are hoping for a serious and plausible whodunnit with believable, realistic characters then you are going to be disappointed."
The Man Who Died Twice (The Thursday Murder Club Book 2),Back with the fabulous four for more first class entertainment. Fun from start to finish,5.0,"Are you ready for round two of the comic crime capers that come courtesy of Coopers Chase retirement village‚Äôs most celebrated residents? Well I certainly was when I picked up the sequel to Richard Osman‚Äôs bestselling debut The Thursday Murder Club, having declared it one of my favourite reads of 2020. Exploding onto the amateur detective scene with as much vitality and enthusiasm as four old age pensioners can muster (and it‚Äôs a lot!) they won the hearts of readers up and down the country so the chance to catch up with the likes of Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron and Ibrahim as they wheedle, manipulate, confuse, connive and charm their way through another investigation is an opportunity too good to miss. I‚Äôm happy to report that this crime busting quartet led by ex spook Elizabeth are back with a vengeance, hogging the limelight as they engage in some lateral thinking and uproarious antics in order to outsmart the latest round of villains who threaten to darken their doorstep. Even though they are busy with their far from successful surveillance of local drug dealer Connie Johnson,  Fairhaven‚Äôs finest cops DCI Chris Hudson and his partner PC Donna De Freitas are again on hand to assist our favourite senior citizens especially when Ibrahim becomes the victim of a vicious mugging. Polish builder Bogdan completes the eclectic band of justice seekers determined to solve the mystery behind a letter addressed to Elizabeth that appears to be written from the deceased Marcus Carmichael. A ghost from the past is all it takes to alert our fantastic four to skulduggery within the criminal fraternity in which the recovery of twenty million pounds worth of diamonds is of paramount importance. Move over the A team the OAP team are here to save the day!!First off I have to comment on how wonderful it is to be reunited with all these familiar characters. I‚Äôve missed their camaraderie, their hilarious conversations, their individual foibles and their ability to behave badly without arousing suspicion. It‚Äôs all this plus the  friendships, the loyalty and support that exist between the gang of four and their growing band of associates that makes this such a delight to read. The dialogue is off the scale humorous so that from the opening discussion in which Joyce is deliberating with her fellow murder club members whether to join Instagram or get a dog for company you know there are going to be laughs aplenty. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve read a crime novel where I‚Äôve laughed so much. Thanks to these intrepid, smart, inventive, resourceful and energetic lot who prove age is no barrier when it comes to enjoying life to the max I had a permanent grin on my face as I followed their escapades. I could only marvel at the ingenious ways in which they disentangle themselves from sticky situations, somehow never the worse for wear!There‚Äôs been a few developments in the lives of these characters since we were last in their company but they are all still game for a laugh and ready to rise to this latest crime solving challenge. Formerly unlucky in love DCI Chris is now on a strict diet thanks to his blossoming relationship with Patrice, who just happens to be Donna‚Äôs mum; Joyce appears to have swapped baking cakes for making sequin embellished friendship bracelets; Bogdan is happily keeping Stephen company challenging him to countless chess games whilst Elizabeth is outmanoeuvring criminal masterminds and Donna still hasn‚Äôt found a suitable boyfriend. It‚Äôs fair to say I don‚Äôt think I could ever tire of these characters who for all their lighthearted silly banter are superb friends to one another. Ron‚Äôs friendship with Ibrahim, becoming his constant companion whilst this quiet,careful and unadventurous man slowly heals is so heartwarming. So too is the new found friendship between Ron‚Äôs grandson Kendrick and the ex psychiatrist who needless to say both prove invaluable in the race to discover the missing diamonds.Combining Elizabeth‚Äôs sharp mind,Joyce‚Äôs flirting, Ibrahim‚Äôs impressive observational skills and Ron‚Äôs use of disguise and underhand tactics you can be sure that retrieving the stolen diamonds is on the cards. However Elizabeth and her acolytes have a few obstacles to overcome on the way to success. Expect danger, devious tactics, double crossings and a few dead bodies! Richard Osman skilfully weaves each strand of the plot together, drawing every single character into the main arena so you‚Äôre never quite sure what to expect next. Literally anything can and does happen! All in all it‚Äôs riotous, rollicking great fun!As for characters it‚Äôs pointless trying to pick a favourite when the author spoils you for choice but I‚Äôm going to anyway!  Elizabeth as the brains behind the operation obviously stands out but once again it‚Äôs ex nurse Joyce who through her diary entries had me in stitches. I just love her voice with it‚Äôs mixture of naivety, flirtatiousness, kindness and eccentricity. Her heart is pure gold but she isn‚Äôt above a bit of gentle persuasion and coercion as Ibrahim knows only too well! The other three members of the murder club couldn‚Äôt wish for a better friend. If I‚Äôm honest I love them all! I like how underneath all the comic capering Richard Osman isn‚Äôt afraid to touch on the type of problems associated with old age such as dementia (Stephen) and how easy it can be to lose one‚Äôs confidence following an unexpected turn of events (Ibrahim). Without being in the least bit patronising and keeping the tone lighthearted he manages to address these issues with both wit, compassion and respect so despite the obstacles they face their value as characters is not diminished and they are not overlooked.If you loved The Thursday Murder Club then I think you‚Äôll love the sequel even more. Richard Osman has triumphed once again with a novel that provides fantastic all round entertainment. Quintessentially English, the plot is pacy, the characters are divine and the humour contagious so it‚Äôs hardly surprising The Man Who Died Twice has shot to the top (again!) of my list of favourite 2021 reads.Super easy to devour in one sitting this is one of those highly anticipated novels you can‚Äôt wait to start yet you don‚Äôt want to finish simply because you‚Äôre in such splendid company.
